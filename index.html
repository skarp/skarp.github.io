    <section id="about">
        <p>Hi! I'm a PhD student in the Machine Learning Department at CMU, where my research focus is <b>deep learning theory</b>. I am advised by Aarti Singh and often work with Yuanzhi Li.<br/><br/>
        I also work part-time at Google Research NYC, where my collaborators have included Satyen Kale, Pranjal Awasthi, Mehryar Mohri, and Behnam Neyshabur, among others.<br/><br/>
        Before grad school, I worked as a software engineer at Google NYC on search quality and the Google Assistant.<br/><br/>
        Before that, I was an undergrad at Princeton, where I studied theoretical computer science and worked with Robert Tarjan and Mark Braverman.

        <h3>More</h3>
        Other interests: longevity, automated science, consciousness, philosophy, psychology, creative writing, puns<br/>
        I'm constantly thinking about ways to improve my systems (learning systems, thought systems, sleep systems, exercise systems, etc.), and I love new ideas in these spaces, so please reach out if you're also a nerd in this respect!<br/>
        I want to understand the way the world works and harness this understanding to bring about incredible, transformative change. Before embarking on my current research journey, I also considered studying either quantum complexity or consciousness.
